# prepackaged-mpf-binaries
Prebuilt binaries for MPF including Python and dependency packages

This repository contains standalone executables for the Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) that can be run on a machine without python, pip, virtual environments, or dependencies. These binaries are built using PyInstaller and are manually generated by the MPF team for supported platforms using MPF version 0.80 and above.
